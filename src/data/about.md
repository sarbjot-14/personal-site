# Intro

I am curious and love learning about various things so that I can protect myself from my own ignorance. Although it can be difficult, I try to keep up with the latest and greatest frameworks and tools in software development. Occasionally, I try to implement my ideas with what I have learned. I love learning about finance, watching NBA, and playing sports with friends.

# Currently

I am a software developer at BroadRidge Financial Solutions working on client onboarding platform. I am also learning some technologies such as .NET, Next.js, and CI/CD. I am open to new opportunities, so don't be afraid to reach out!
