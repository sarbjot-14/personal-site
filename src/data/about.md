# Intro

I am curious and love learning about various things so that I can protect myself from my own ignorance. Although it can be difficult, I try to keep up with the latest and greatest frameworks and tools in software development. Occasionally, I try to implement my ideas with what I have learned. I love learning about finance, watching NBA, and playing sports with friends.

# Currently

I am currently looking for software development position. I would like to do backend, but am open to frontend web dev roles too! I have experience in React, Angular, Express. I am currently learning Next.js, Tailwind, AWS, .Net, and Docker.
